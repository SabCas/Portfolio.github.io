 In this project I worked on a medical imaging segmentation challenges, the Grand Challenge HaN-Seg. Using advanced tools such as the MONAI Framework, my work revolves around automating the precise delineation of Organs-at-risk (OARs) within the Head and Neck (HaN) region from CT and MR images. These efforts are geared towards enhancing accuracy and scalability in medical image analysis for impactful healthcare applications.
